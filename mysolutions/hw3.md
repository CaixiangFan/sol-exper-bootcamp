This facilitates Keccak256 hash scheme and elliptic-curve computations. But, it increases the complexity of machine and smart contract design.

<span style="color:lightblue">**2.	What would happen if the implementation of a precompiled contract varied between
Ethereum clients?**</span>

If the implementation of a precompiled contract varied between Ethereum clients, it would lead to interoperability issues and compromise the integrity of the Ethereum network. Different clients would produce different results for the same inputs, leading to inconsistencies in the state of the Ethereum blockchain. This could also result in a lack of trust in the Ethereum network as a whole, potentially leading to a loss of value and decreased usage of the platform. To maintain the integrity and security of the Ethereum network, it is important for all clients to have a consistent implementation of precompiled contracts.
