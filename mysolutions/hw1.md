<span style="color:lightblue">**1.	Why is client diversity important for Ethereum?**</span>

Multiple, independently developed and maintained clients exist because client diversity makes the network more resilient to attacks and bugs. Having many independently developed and maintained clients is vital for the health of a decentralized network:

1)	With a roughly even distribution of nodes across many clients, the likelihood of most clients suffering from a shared issue is small, and as a result, resulting in a more robust network.
2)	Client diversity also offers resilience to attacks. 
3)	Although the incorrect split and finalization problems are unlikely scenarios in BFT-based PoS consensus, the Ethereum eco-system can mitigate their risk by evening out the distribution of clients across the active nodes. Ideally, no consensus client would ever reach a 33% share of the total nodes.
4)	The lesser the client diversity, the greater the burden of responsibility for the developers maintaining the majority client. Spreading this responsibility across multiple teams is good for both the health of Ethereum's network of nodes and its network of people.

The account state, comprises the following four fields:
- nonce: A scalar value equal to the number of transactions sent from this address or,
 in the case of accounts with associated code, the number of contract-creations made by this account.
- balance: A scalar value equal to the number of Wei owned by this address.
- storageRoot: A 256-bit hash of the root node of a Merkle Patricia tree that encodes the storage contents of the account (a mapping between 256-bit integer values), encoded into the trie as a mapping from the Keccak 256-bit hash of the 256-bit integer keys to the RLP-encoded 256-bit integer values.
- codeHash: The hash of the EVM code of this account—this is the code that gets executed should this address receive a message call; it is immutable and thus, unlike all other fields, cannot be changed after construction.

<span style="color:lightblue">**3.	Where is the full Ethereum state held?**</span>

Ethereum has the property that every block contains something called the "state root": the root hash of a specialized kind of Merkle tree which stores the entire state of the system: all account balances, contract storage, contract code and account nonces are inside. 

<span style="color:lightblue">4.	**What is a replay attack? which 2 pieces of information can prevent it?**</span>

A replay attack is commonly referred to as a man-in-the-middle attack. It happens when a hacker or malicious actor secretly connects, intercepts, and tweaks data on a secure network so that the data/transaction is delayed or repeated to the detriment of the originator. Replay attacks can also happen in the blockchain space, especially during chain splits or hard forks.
Nonce and timestamp can prevent the replay attacks within a chain. When multiple chains are involved, ChainID is added to prevent the replay attacks.

**ChainID**: Many of the chains in the Ethereum ecosystem have exactly the same transaction format. Without chain ID being part of the transaction payload needing to be signed by the private key, a transaction—for example, a transfer of 1 ETH from Account A to Account B—would be identical on Ethereum mainnet, Ropsten, Polygon, and other networks. If Account A signed the transaction and broadcasted it on Ropsten, anyone could take it, broadcast it on mainnet, and it would appear valid.

**Nonce**: A nonce is a unique number assigned to each transaction, which ensures that each transaction is executed only once. When a transaction is broadcasted, the nonce is included in the transaction data and is used to confirm that the transaction is not a replay of a previous transaction.

**Timestamp**: Timestamp is the time at which a transaction was broadcasted on the Ethereum network. When a transaction is received, the timestamp is checked to ensure that the transaction was not sent earlier. This helps prevent replay attacks by ensuring that the transaction is not a repeat of a previously broadcasted transaction.

<span style="color:lightblue">5.	**In a contract how do we know who called a view function?**</span>

In Ethereum, the information about the caller of a view function is not explicitly recorded in the contract's code. However, the caller's Ethereum address can be inferred using the **msg.sender** variable. This variable is automatically populated by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) with the Ethereum address of the account that is calling the function. This allows the contract to access the address of the caller and determine if the caller has the necessary permissions to call the view function.
